Multi-modal entity alignment aims to identify equivalent entities between two different multi-modal knowledge graphs, which consist of structural triples and images associated with entities. Unfortunately, prior works fuse the multi-modal knowledge of all entities only via solely one single fusion strategy. Therefore, the impact of the fusion strategy on individual entities could be largely ignored. To solve this challenge, we propose AMFÂ²SEA, an adaptive multi-modal feature fusion strategy for entity alignment, which dynamically selects the optimal entity-level feature fusion strategy. Additionally, we build a new dataset based on DBP15K, which includes a full set of entity images from multiple inconsistent web sources, making it more representative of the real world. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance compared to models using the same modality on DBP15K and its variants with richer image sources and styles.
