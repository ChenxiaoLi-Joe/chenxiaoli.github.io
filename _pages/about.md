Hello there! I am Chenxiao Li! I am now a Third-year (2022 - 2025) master’s student from [Software College](http://sc.neu.edu.cn/english/main.htm), [Northeastern University](https://english.neu.edu.cn/). I am very fortunate to be supervised by [Prof. Qiang Tong](http://faculty.neu.edu.cn/tongq/en/index.htm) from Software College, and  co-supervised  by [Prof. Fu Zhang](http://faculty.neu.edu.cn/zhangfu/zh_CN/index.htm) and [Jingwei Cheng](http://www.cse.neu.edu.cn/2019/0303/c6641a157424/page.htm) from the School of Computer Science and Engineering. 

Before that, I received my Bachelor’s degree with an outstanding graduate award of Liaoning Province and was recommended for master's degree program with exam exemption due to exceptional academic performance and research performance.

My research interests lie broadly in Knowledge graphs and Large language models.  Currently, my research focuses on large language models and multi-modal learning, specifically knowledge-driven LLMs, and knowledge-driven multi-modal learning, which involves exploring the integration of knowledge into multi-modal learning or incorporating multi-modal learning into the representation of knowledge. In this case, this will contribute to the development of human-centered NLP in the real world.
