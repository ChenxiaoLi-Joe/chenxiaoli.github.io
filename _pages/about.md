Hello there! I am Chenxiao Li! I graduated with a Master’s degree in Software Engineering from [Software College](http://sc.neu.edu.cn/english/main.htm), [Northeastern University](https://english.neu.edu.cn/). I am very fortunate to be supervised by [Prof. Qiang Tong](http://faculty.neu.edu.cn/tongq/en/index.htm) from Software College, and  co-supervised  by [Prof. Fu Zhang](http://faculty.neu.edu.cn/zhangfu/zh_CN/index.htm) and [Jingwei Cheng](http://www.cse.neu.edu.cn/2019/0303/c6641a157424/page.htm) from the School of Computer Science and Engineering. 

Before that, I received my Bachelor’s degree with an outstanding graduate award of Liaoning Province and was recommended for master's degree program with exam exemption due to exceptional academic performance and research performance.

My research focuses on multi-modal learning, with an emphasis on vision-language models and multi-modal large language models. I am passionate about developing knowledge-enhanced visual reasoning models and designing structural data representations that bridge the gap between perception and cognition. The goal of my research is to enable machines to understand the world in a more human-like manner, thereby fostering more natural and intelligent human-computer interactions.
